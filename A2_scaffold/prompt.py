PE6201 · A2 scaffold — WHAT THE MODEL ACTUALLY SEES  (D2b)
====================================================================
THIS FILE ANSWERS ONE QUESTION: what is sent to the model?

    python3 run_eval.py --prompt

prints the exact text, in full. Read it before you tune anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL

D2(b) asks you to rewrite your tool descriptors and MEASURE what the
rewrite did. That is only meaningful if the descriptors actually reach
the model - otherwise you are editing documentation and reporting it as
an experiment.

So the chain is deliberately short and visible:

    tools.DESCRIPTORS  ->  build_system_prompt()  ->  the system message

Change a descriptor, run `--prompt`, and you can see the difference in
the text the model receives. That difference is your v1 -> v2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ON THE SCRIPTED BACKEND, NOTHING HERE IS SENT.

The scripted backend replays moves you wrote down; it never consults a
model, so it never reads this prompt. That is what makes it free and
deterministic - and it is also why D2(b)'s prompt comparison is part of
the LIVE battery, not the scripted run. Your v1-versus-v2 numbers can
only come from real calls.

Everything else - D3(b), D5(a), D7 - is scripted and free.
