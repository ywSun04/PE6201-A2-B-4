PE6201 · A2 scaffold — THE TOOL LAYER  (D2)
====================================================================
A tool reads ONE thing from the reference data and returns ONE fact.

THE NAMES BELOW ARE OURS, NOT YOURS. Appendix A says so and so does the
brief: these describe work that has to happen, not an interface you must
implement. Rename, re-argument, merge, split, add. What you cannot do is
change the ROUTING RULE or the GATED ACTION - the answer key is written
against those.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO READ THIS FILE

Every tool carries the same comment block, and it is worth copying the
shape for your own tools:

    WHAT IT DOES   one sentence, in domain language
    READS          which JSON file(s) it touches
    RETURNS        the exact shape that comes back
    RETURNS NONE   when, AND WHAT THAT MEANS - these are different
    WATCH OUT      the mistake this tool exists to prevent

The fourth line is the one that separates a tool from a lookup. "Returns
None" is a fact about Python. "Returns None, which means no approval
exists - NOT that the procedure is uncovered" is a fact about the
business, and it is what stops a wrong decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SIX-FIELD DESCRIPTOR (D2b)

EVERY tool below has one, at the bottom of this file. THEY ARE NOT
DECORATION - `prompt.build_system_prompt()` assembles them into the text
the model is actually sent, so editing one changes what the agent sees.

    python3 run_eval.py --prompt      shows the exact text, and its size

That is what makes D2(b) measurable. Rewrite the descriptors, print the
prompt, and the diff is precisely what you are claiming to have
measured. The v1 you compare against should be a genuinely worse version
you wrote - and note the prompt is resent EVERY TURN, so a longer
descriptor has to earn its length on every turn of every run.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
POKA-YOKE: make the wrong call impossible rather than documented.
Two examples below - `get_clinic_slots` demands a band so you cannot
accidentally book an urgent patient into a routine slot, and
`check_coverage` demands a policy_id so you cannot check coverage
against no policy at all.

    normal and means nothing is booked.

                       red_flag_term is not None   -> ESCALATE, stop
                       right_department is False   -> ESCALATE, stop

                       otherwise                   -> carry on to slots

                   An agent that queries a slot after finding a red flag
                   has failed the case even if it never books.

    WHY THIS IS ONE TOOL AND NOT FOUR - a design choice worth arguing
    with. The four questions are always asked, always in this order, and
    each can end the run. Splitting them into four tools would invite an
    agent to ask them out of order or skip one, and would cost three
    extra turns for no information. The cost is that this tool is doing
    four things, which is usually bad design.
    D2(a) marks your REASONING about the tool set, not ours - so if you
    split it, say why, and you are on perfectly good ground.

    HOW THE THREE TEXT CHECKS WORK, so you can see how crude they are:
      - red flags   substring match of the specialty's red_flag_terms
      - department  substring match of the specialty's `treats` words
      - band        first urgency band whose trigger_terms appear;
                    NO TRIGGER FOUND MEANS ROUTINE, which is the default
                    and not an error
    Substring matching is fragile on purpose. Your prompt-injection
    cases will attack exactly this, and improving it is fair game - just
    do not change the PROTOCOL, only how you detect it.

                   you - so an empty list can mean either. If your

    example in the scaffold of designing an interface so the wrong call
    cannot be made.

    window closing 2026-11-04. THREE slots sit earlier inside that window
    with capacity free - OPH-C1 on 09-15 and 09-22 (urgent) and OPH-C3 on
    09-29 (soon). A team filtering by date alone books one of them and
    fails the case. Only the band excludes them, and making band an
    argument rather than an optional filter is what makes forgetting it
    impossible rather than merely documented.

    The window is passed as **kwargs so `from` can be used as a name -
    it is a Python keyword and cannot be a normal parameter. That is a
    small ugliness bought deliberately, to keep the domain word.

    WHAT IT DOES   compares the claim against the claims history on ALL
                   FOUR facts.
    READS          data_A/decided_claims.json
    RETURNS        the prior decision row, or None
    RETURNS NONE   when nothing matches - which is the normal case and
                   means carry on.
    WATCH OUT      THE CLAIM ID IS NOT ONE OF THE FACTS. A resubmission
                   arrives with a NEW id, so matching on it finds nothing,
                   ever, and the case fails silently.

    MATCH ON ALL FOUR: member, hospital, date of service, lines. The
    shipped history holds four rows and only ONE queued claim is a true
    duplicate of any of them. The other three history rows are
    NEAR-MISSES, each differing from a real claim on exactly one fact:

        CLM-8710  vs CLM-8933   nothing differs - the true duplicate
        CLM-8702  vs CLM-8850   the date of service differs
        CLM-8726  vs CLM-8960   the LINES differ
        CLM-8688  vs nothing    just history to walk past

    So an agent matching on the date alone, or on member and date, or on
    member and hospital and date, WRONGLY ESCALATES a claim that is
    perfectly fine. Only the full comparison gets all fifteen right. The
    near-misses are in the data deliberately, to make that testable.
