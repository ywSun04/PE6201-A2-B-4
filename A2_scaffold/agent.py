PE6201 · A2 scaffold — THE AGENT LOOP  (D1)
====================================================================
    thought -> action -> observation -> repeat -> final

That is the whole of ReAct, and it is hand-rolled here on purpose. No
framework owns your loop: when it misbehaves you need to be able to
read the twelve lines that did it.

WHAT MAKES THIS AN AGENT RATHER THAN A WORKFLOW: the number of steps is
decided by the DATA, not by you. A one-line claim with a live policy is
a short run. A four-line claim with a pre-authorisation to chase is a
long one. You did not write that branch - the record did.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUMENTATION IS NOT OPTIONAL

Every run records turns, tokens, cost, every tool call and every
guardrail event. D6's cost model and D7's loop failure both need
numbers that were captured WHILE THE RUN HAPPENED. A team that adds
instrumentation afterwards has to run the whole battery again.

You cannot report a failure you had no way of noticing.
